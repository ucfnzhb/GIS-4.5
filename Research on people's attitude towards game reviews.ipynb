    "Nowadays, games have become an indispensable form of entertainment for contemporary teenagers. Different games and different game crowds will cause different evaluations of the game. Game players post their attitude towards the game under the game review module. As a result, what kind of game reviews will be considered valuable reviews? This article selects Steam's comment area as a data source to predict how satisfied people are with a new comment. The reason for choosing the Steam data set is that data from the tracking site Steam Spy (https://steamspy.com/) indicated that Steam currently has 281 million registered accounts worldwide and 17.5 million online users until 2017. The population base is large, and the types of games are diversified, which can represent the game market to a certain extent."

    "A decision tree is a basic classification and regression method with a tree structure of nodes and directed edges. The nodes have internal nodes and leaf nodes. The internal nodes represent a feature or attribute, and the leaf nodes represent a class. There are three algorithms for feature selection of decision trees: Gini coefficient, information entropy, and information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini coefficient reflects the probability that randomly selected samples in the data set are misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information entropy reflects the uncertainty of the sample, the greater the information entropy, the greater the uncertainty of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information gain is based on information entropy, it calculated the difference between the information entropy of the parent node and the information entropy of the child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that, when using information entropy, Scikit-learn calculates the information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information entropy (in Scikit-learn) is more sensitive to impurity than the Gini Coefficient, as a result when information entropy is used as an indicator, the growth of the decision tree will be ‘finer’. However, for high-dimensional data or noisy data, information entropy is easy to overfit. Because there are fewer variables to make decisions in this analysis, information entropy is used.\n",

But the model is too simple to effectively sort different documents, thus, the keyword extraction effect is not good.\n",

    "The TF-IDF model uses a common weighted counting method to calculate the word frequency to obtain keywords. Comparing with the Boolean model, the keyword extraction is more effective, and the speed of the calculation is faster than the Word vector model. However, because the importance of word frequency may not be related to word frequency itself (e.g.: I, the), the result may have some deviations. In addition, the sequence of the word is not considered in this method.\n",

    "Word vector model is a model that uses word-to-word similarities and differences to encode word vectors. The accuracy of the word vector model is the highest of the three methods, and the sequence of the word is considered in this method. However, the vector dimension required for a word is generally between 50-300 dimensions, which means it requires a large amount of computation. As a result, the calculation speed is slow. On the other hand, the Gensim corpus needs to be installed which is not included in the anaconda initialization library.\n",

Therefore, the sequence of the word is not a very important issue. Simultaneously, in order to reduce the amount of calculation, the TF-IDF method is used.\n",

It means that some unimportant words (e.g.: ‘game’) but use frequently, will reduce the weight of some words that can represent the actual meaning of the sentence. (e.g.: 'simple'). To solve this problem, the inverse document frequency factor is introduced, which reduces the weight of entries that appear very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of the frequency of words that appear rarely.
